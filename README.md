### OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of "VR Sanctuary" is to create an innovative and immersive virtual reality project that offers users a captivating tour through forests or wildlife sanctuaries. Birds chirping and water shimmering in mellow sunlight, the home to green lush nature – the wildlife sanctuary. It is India’s one and only place where one of the most significant environmental and geographical marvels can be witnessed! 
### INTRODUCTION
Step into a world where tranquility and excitement converge, where nature's beauty embraces the thrill of the wild. Welcome to VR Sanctuary: an immersive Unity project that invites you to explore a realm of breathtaking landscapes and untamed wonders.
A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings are protected from any sort of disturbance. The capturing, killing and poaching of animals is strictly prohibited in these regions.They aim at providing a comfortable living to the animals. India has beautiful wildlife sanctuaries, with dense forests, large rivers, high and beautiful mountains.
When it comes to wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, India  has plenty of them. It is the royal abode of unique species of flora and fauna. These parks are specially taken care of by the government, in order to charm lots of tourists. Exciting jeep rides, adventurous night safaris, audio-visual facilities as well as convenient transport systems attract many foreigners too. Another plus point of these sanctuaries is that they are adorned with glittering lakes reflecting pure scenic beauty.
### SCENE DESCRIPTION
The virtual reality scene in "sanctuary VR" is thoughtfully designed to offer an authentic and engaging experience of the tour across the sanctuary:

#### Importance of Wildlife Sanctuaries
There are a number of reasons for establishing wildlife sanctuaries. Some of the reasons are listed below:
1. The wildlife sanctuaries are established to protect the endangered species.
2. It is quite difficult to always relocate the animals from their natural habitat, therefore, protecting them in their natural environment is advantageous.
3. The endangered species are specially monitored in the wildlife sanctuaries. If they reproduce and grow in number while under protection, few specimens can be kept for breeding in the conservation parks for their survival.
4. Biologist activities and research are permitted in the wildlife sanctuaries so that they can learn about the animals living there.
5. A few sanctuaries take in injured and abandoned animals and rehabilitate them to health before releasing them in the forest.
Wildlife sanctuaries preserve the endangered species and protect them from humans and predators.
